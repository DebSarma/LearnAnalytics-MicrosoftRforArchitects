# Importing Data

There are many ways of getting your data into R, each with different strengths. When working data saved in text files or csv's, you can use the standard R function (available in the `utitls` package,  loaded with every R installation), `read.table` and it's cousin `read.csv`. When working with very large data, see the `data.table::fread` function, or the `readr` package.

```{r read-data}
hvac <- read.csv("HVAC.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)
building <- read.csv("building.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)
head(hvac)
head(building)
dim(hvac)
dim(building)
```

We used a couple of additional arguments to make sure our data was imported in the corret format. First, since our csv files have a header row, we set the `header` argument to the value `TRUE`. Secondally, and more importantly, we set the argument `stringsAsFactors` to `FALSE`. Convertign factors into other data types is a frequent stress-inducing problem in R. By setting `stringsAsFactors` to `FALSE`, we can ensure that our character columns (columns containing strings) are not converted to factor columns. If we later want to use factors, we can conver the character columns into factors, which is usually met with less errors than converting factors into characters/numerics.


# Summary Statistics with R

The return value for the `read.csv` function is a `data.frame`, which is a special kind of list. The `summary` function has a specific method for `data.frames`, which provides summary statistics for each column. 


```{r summary-stats}
summary(building)
summary(hvac)

```


The output provides five point summary statistics for the numeric columns as well as the average. For character data, there is less information provided. If we convert the character columns into factor variables, we will see truncated tabulations of their values.

All data types in R have a handy `as.` function to convert from one data type to another. In order to convert multiple columns at once, we'll use the `lapply` function and select the columns we wan to convert.

```{r factor-conv}
build_fctrs <- c("BuildingID", "Country")
building[build_fctrs] <- lapply(building[build_fctrs], as.factor)
hvac$BuildingID <- as.factor(hvac$BuildingID)
summary(hvac)
summary(building)


```

We should also convert the Date column into a POSIXct date object. 

```{r date-conv}
head(hvac)
hvac$Date_Time <- as.POSIXct(paste(hvac$Date, 
                                   hvac$Time, sep = " "), 
                             format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S")
hvac$Date <- as.Date(hvac$Date_Time)
hvac$Time <- strftime(hvac$Date_Time, format = "%H:%M:%S")
head(hvac)
```

To make your life easier when working with dates, take a look at the [lubridate](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html) package.


## Merging Data

Let's merge the hvac and buildings `data.frames` together.

```{r merge-df}

build_temps <- merge(building, hvac, by = "BuildingID")
head(build_temps)

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's visualize the temperature by sites. We will use the awesome [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) package for our visualizations. 

Let's calculate the difference between ActualTemp and TargetTemp.

```{r diff-temp}
build_temps$DiffTemp <- with(build_temps, ActualTemp - TargetTemp)

```

Let's use the ggplot library to visualize the temperature differences as boxplots. the `ggplot2` package makes this easy to do. We pass the aesthetics to plot, in this case, the building id and the difference in temperature. Just to make the different IDs easier to compare, we'll fill by id as wel. 

```{r plot-temp}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(build_temps, aes(x = BuildingID, y = DiffTemp, fill = BuildingID)) + geom_boxplot() + guides(fill = F) + theme_bw()

```

Similarily for country:

```{r plot-country}
ggplot(build_temps, aes(x = Country, y = DiffTemp, fill = Country)) + geom_boxplot() + guides(fill = F) + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```


Suppose we just want to see which buildings had the most frequent excursions in temperature, where we'll define excursion as any data point where ActualTemp > TargetTemp.

We will use the `dplyr` package to aggregate the data.

```{r group-exc, message = F, warning = F}
library(dplyr)
build_temps <- build_temps %>% mutate(TempExcursion = ifelse(DiffTemp > 0, "Excursion", "Within Limits"), TempFlag = ifelse(DiffTemp > 0, 1, 0))
excursions <- build_temps %>% group_by(TempExcursion, BuildingID) %>% summarize(Count = n())
ggplot(excursions, aes(x = BuildingID, y = Count, fill = TempExcursion)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'stack') + theme_bw()
```

# Predicting Modeling with R

Let's try to estimate the probability that there'll be a temperature excursion given building temperature attributes. 

## Split Data into Training and Validation Set

In order to evaluate our model, we will need a set that we can use to estimate/train our model, and then another set that we can test our model. The test set should be separate from our training set.

The base package in R has a handy function named `split` for splitting data by the values of one of it's columns, and it returns a named list with an element for each value in the split column.

```{r split-ds}
range(build_temps$Date)
build_temps$SplitValue <- ifelse(build_temps$Date > "2013-06-15", "Test", "Train")
split_df <- split(build_temps, build_temps$SplitValue)
names(split_df)
lapply(split_df, dim)
lapply(split_df, function(x) range(x$Date))
```

## Train a Binomial Logistic Regression Model

Every modeling function in R starts with a formula to estimate. We will create our model formula, and then pass that to the `glm` function in the `stats` package to estimate a binary classification model, using the logistic link function. 


```{r train-model}
temp_formula <- TempFlag ~ BuildingID + BuildingMgr + BuildingAge + HVACproduct + Country + Time + System + SystemAge
train_model <- glm(temp_formula, family = 'binomial', data = split_df[["Train"]])
```

## Score Model on Test Set

Now that we have our trained model, we can score it on our test test.

```{r score-model}
predictions <- predict(train_model, newdata = split_df[["Test"]], 
                       type = 'response')
summary(predictions)
```


We will use the `pROC` package to estimate our model's accuracy. 

```{r est-auc}
library(pROC)
roc_curve <- roc(split_df[["Test"]]$TempFlag, predictions)
auc_value <- auc(roc_curve)
auc_value
plot(roc_curve)
```
